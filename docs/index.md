Spectacular is a <abbr title='Behavior-Driven Development'>BDD</abbr> framework for CoffeeScript and JavaScript whose attempt to bring the power of RSpec to JavaScript. Spectacular try to favor the best practices used for writing [better RSpec tests](http://betterspecs.org/) in its design.


Below is a small snippets of how Spectacular can be used

```coffeescript
describe Array, ->
  given 'item', -> foo: 'bar'

  it -> should exist

  itsInstance 'length', -> should equal 0

  describe '::indexOf', ->
    itsReturn with: (-> [@item]), -> should equal -1

    context 'with an item present in the array', ->
      subject 'array', -> [@item]

      specify 'the returned value', ->
        expect(@array.indexOf @item).to equal 0
```
